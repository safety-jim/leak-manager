# White-hat style token alert project

Hey, 

Here, if your discord bot tokens are found on the internet, they are placed here to be regenerated by discord.

This is a safe way of making sure your bots and servers are protected if we find your bots' tokens in the internet.
Here, I run this to help make the internet a better place, and your discord experience better.

# How to prevent this going forward
If you're using repl.it, hide the token in the secrets (**.env files are no longer supported and hidden by replit**).
Else, you can use a `.env` file, and if on github, make sure to specify that token files are not publically viewable in `.gitignore`.
