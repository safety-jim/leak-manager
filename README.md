Hey, here, if your discord bot tokens are found on the internet, they are placed here to be regenerated.

# How to prevent this going forward
If you're using repl.it, hide the token in the secrets file.
Else, you can use a `.env` file, and if on github, make sure to specify that token files are not publically viewable in `.gitignore`.
